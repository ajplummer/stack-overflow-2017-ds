# Using Data Science to Gain Insights from Stack Overflow Survey Data
This work was completed as part of Udacity's Data Scientist for Enterprise course.

## Installation
The main content of this repository is a Jupyter Notebook running on Python 3.0.

To run the notebook you will need:
- Python 3.0
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Sklearn
- Juypter

## Project Motivations
As a former professional developer who has not been active in the developer community in many years, I was interested to look at the Stack Overflow Survey data from 2017 and see if I could use data science to answer a few questions of interest.

The Stack Overflow Survey is a great source of data for this work because it has a good size (both in terms of # of questions asked and # of responses) and needs a bit of wrangling (lots of nulls).

## File Descriptions
- Project 4 - Using Data Science to Gain Insights from Stack Overflow Survey Data.ipynb - This is the Jupyter Notebook storing my code and markdown related to the project.
- README.md - This file.

## How to Interact with This Project
The best way to interact with this project is to open up the Notebook and browse through the code. The Notebook was saved with all code run so you can just look at the output (and my commentary) without having to re-run everything yourself. Feel free to edit the code and re-run if desired.

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements, Etc.
The data was downloaded via Kaggle but is provided by Stack Overflow. As noted on the Kaggle site: "Data is directly taken from StackOverflow and licensed under the ODbL license."

The code was written by me, A.J. Plummer, with some functions copied (either word-for-word or in spirit) from Udacity coursework. Those functions are noted in the comments in the Notebook itself.

Thank you to Udacity for putting together a great "real world" exercise for us and to my company, Mars, Inc., for enabling me to take on this course!
